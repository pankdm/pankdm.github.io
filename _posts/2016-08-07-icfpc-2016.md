[This year's ICFPC](http://icfpc2016.blogspot.com/2016/08/task-description.html)
was about folding origami and creating origami problems for other teams to solve.

Our team `Snakes vs Lambdas` consisted of almost 4 members this year.
We got into 22nd place according to frozen leaderboard.
Full results will be announced on the conference in September.
I would expect for us to stay around the same place +/- 3 positions.
(**update:** we finished at 26th place, see bottom of the note)

# **General impression**

First of all, the contest was really great!
In particular it had the following qualities that distinguish amazing ICFPC
from mediocre ones:

* Common sense problem with cool mathematical background.
* Players are competing against each other rather than for some abstract score.
(this wasn't a full PVP as in ICFPC-2011, but still a close one)
* As a consequence of previous point, you were never "done" as the new and
more complex problems were revealing each hour. It felt like an arms race.
* Leaderboard.
* Well defined API for programmatic access with clear limits.
* Problem was deep enough to explore different routes.
* Friendly checkers: keeping the best submitted score, good error messages.
* Organizers were fun folks: great problem flavour, good jokes in their twitter

# **Solution**

I can cover this part only briefly as I was mostly focused on submitting problems
and general infrastructure.


Initially we thought about some brute force way of unfolding by edges,
but even for small test case it felt too computationally intensive.

The breakthrough was to notice, that if polygon is convex and fully inside
the source square then it's possible to find exact solution:
wrap the figure as if using piece of paper.

Even though the algorithm looks simple, coding it is non-trivial.
We had to spent some time thinking about good abstractions to make it work:

* Maintain list of `(facet, T)`, where `T` is the 3x3 matrix for congruent mapping
that is currently applied for this facet.
* Originally it has only 1 element `(square, diag(3))`.
* Take the next edge `L` of target figure.
* For each `facet`, find intersection of `L` and `T(facet)`.
* If it's non empty, replace `(facet, T)` by two `(facet1, T)`, `(facet2, R * T)`,
where `facet2` is the one that on different side with figure and `R` is matrix for
reflection by edge `L`.
* Continue process until reaching the limit on solution or nothing has changed.


This process worked pretty good: for non-convex it was finding good approximation,
for convex the solution was exact. The problem was to fit the figure into original
square. We need to find rotation so that conditions are true `max(x) - min(x) <= 1` and
`max(y) - min(y) <= 1`. All coordinates should be rational so such rotations
correspond to pythagorean triples. We try all triples under 1000 and angles formed
by segments in the figure.

This was a main idea of our algorithm that we used. The source code is in
[`origami_deploy_rot.py`](https://github.com/pankdm/icfpc-2016/blob/master/solve_convex/origami_deploy_rot.py).

* Total downloaded problems: **3528**
* Sent solutions: **3464**
* Solved perfectly: **1006**
* Our problems: **45**
* Server error: **21**


Around 24 hours before the end of context our 4th team member appeared who
was then writing solution for unfolding problem (the type of problems our algorithm
was bad at solving). He implemented [`nagibagtor`](https://github.com/pankdm/icfpc-2016/tree/master/nagibagtor) -
brute force approach for unfolding polygons using `C++`
and `CGAL` as geometry library, but it didn't give significant wins.
Contest was almost over at that time so we didn't have time develop it further.

# **Submitted problems**

**T+25 hours:** Our first problem. We [hardcoded](https://github.com/pankdm/icfpc-2016/blob/master/gen_problems/ship.py) all coordinates and facets.

**T+26 hours:** We added some obfuscation in the form of rotation and shift.

**T+33 hours:** Simple bend.

<img src="img/icfpc-2016/t2402.png" style="width: 50%;"/>

**T+43 hours:** Reflections against 3 random lines.

<img src="img/icfpc-2016/t3973.png" style="width: 50%;"/>

**T+49 hours:** We applied theory about sum of alternated angles and produced this
interesting example that couldn't be constructed using paper.
We wrote a script `sgibatel.py` that calculated resulting coordinates.

**T+54 hours:** We were trying to produce this example using the same theorem and script,
but discovered several bugs in the program. After fixing a some of them we got almost the right result.
But the right bottom corner was not quite there and it was already too late in the night
to debug so we abandoned this approach.

<!-- <img src="img/icfpc-2016/t5512.png" style="width: 50%;"/> -->

**T+65 hours:** Our diamond-like problem was solved by number of teams. Presumably
they were able to brute force it, so we added a few more reflections.
In the end, this type of problems was solved only by 1 team.

# **Infrastructure**

We were using dropbox for synchronization between team members.
It works really great! You write your scripts that produces files in filesystem
and they become automatically available for scripts of others. We wrote a bunch
of such scripts that helped to semi-automate (we didn't enable cron jobs)
dealing with problems. This section will cover more details of this.

Here is subset of directory structure for our project.

```
Dropbox/
  - snapshots/
    - 1470603600
    - 1470610800
  - latest_snapshot -> snapshots/1470610800
  - tasks/
    - t1014.txt
    - t1018.txt
  - img/
    - t1014.png
    - t1018.png
  - solve_convex/
    - sols/
      - s1014
      - s1014_0.893841
      - s1018_1.0
  - js/
    - index.html
    - generic_queue.html
  - download_new_problems.py
  - convert_all_to_png.sh
  - new_queue.txt
  - approx_queue.txt
```


[`download_new_problems.py`](https://github.com/pankdm/icfpc-2016/blob/master/download_new_problems.py)

  1. fetches information about all available snapshot
  2. downloads the latest one to `snapshots/`
  3. creates a symlink `latest_snapshot` to it
  4. goes through the list of available problems and finds the problem statements that are missing
  5. downloads missing problems to `tasks/` dir.


[`convert_all_to_png`](https://github.com/pankdm/icfpc-2016/blob/master/convert_all_to_png)

  1. goes through the list of files in `tasks/t{Id}.txt`
  2. creates a visualization of task in `img/t{Id}.png`


[`origami_deploy_rot.py`](https://github.com/pankdm/icfpc-2016/blob/master/solve_convex/origami_deploy_rot.py): our solver. Reads problem description from `stdin` and writes solution to `stdout`.

We used `sols/s{Id}` for solutions and `sols/s{Id}_{resemblence}` for submitted solutions.
We wrote hacky bash script that was going through the list of problems,
solving them and writing resulting files.
There was another script that was sending solved problems without a resemblence.
The scripts were smart enough not to do the same work twice by checking if particular
file already existed. Since there is per-second rate limit, the sending script
should work only from one computer, while solving scripts could work in parallel.


We wrote a [`pipe_line.py`](https://github.com/pankdm/icfpc-2016/blob/master/solve_convex/pipe_line.py)
script that was computing `new_queue.txt` and `approx_queue.txt`. These are the order
in which the solver should process files. `new_queue.txt` is for tasks that doesn't have
any solution. `approx_queue.txt` is for tasks without exact solution, sorted by amount of score
we got in case of solving it precisely.

To deal with rate limiting I tried using `ratelimit` library in python:

```python
from ratelimit import *

@rate_limited(1)
def make_request(self, endpoint, use_json=True):
  ...

```
But then we used good old `sleep` and retry logic, as most of the communication was
happening outside python via `curl`.

We also built visualization html pages on top of generated files
(mainly `img/` and `latest_snapshot`):

* Leader board with clickable team names to see problems they submitted.
It also contains score for submitted problems.
* The tasks we submitted
* Queues visualization

The code lives in [`js/`](https://github.com/pankdm/icfpc-2016/blob/master/js/) and
UI itself is available at [http://pankdm.github.io/icfpc/2016/](http://pankdm.github.io/icfpc-2016-ui/).
