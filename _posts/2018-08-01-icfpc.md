[1] The exact rank is unknown as they never released the final standings.
We only know we are somewhere between top25 and top50,
and guesstimated ~top40 based on linear interpolation of score

[2] We actually had pretty good submission. We finished in 7th place in lightning round and
were on 3rd place in frozen monitor 6 hours before the end of contest.
But apparently there was a bug in our checker and many solutions failed
on final evaluation.
