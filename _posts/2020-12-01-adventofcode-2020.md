This is my notes about solving Advent of Code 2020 in Rust. 


# Day 1

- There was outage for the first 10 minutes so there were no leaderboard scores
- I solved this using 3 nested loops:

```rust
for i in 0..x.len() {
    for j in 0..i {
        for k in 0..j {
            if x[i] + x[j] + x[k] == 2020 {
                return x[i] * x[j] * x[k];
            }
        }
    }
}
```

- Afterwards learned about `combinations` function from [`itertools` crate](https://docs.rs/itertools/0.9.0/itertools/trait.Itertools.html#method.combinations):

```rust
let v = x
    .iter()
    .cloned()
    .combinations(3)
    .filter(|it| it.iter().sum::<i64>() == 2020)
    .next()
    .unwrap();
return v[0] * v[1] * v[2]
```


# Day 2


- Solved in 5/9 minutes and got around 800th place overall

- Wasted some time figuring out how to index `String`-s in Rust. The syntax is pretty ugly:

```rust
let ch = parts[1].chars().nth(0).unwrap();
```

- Lost another minute or so with incorrect answers as missed 1-indexing of arrays
- Initially did some parsing using my `split_string` and `parse_i64` functions:

```rust
let parts = split_string(line, " ");
let nums = split_string(&parts[0], "-");
let a = parse_i64(&nums[0]);
let b = parse_i64(&nums[1]);
let ch = parts[1].chars().nth(0).unwrap();
let pass = parts[2];
```

- Afterwards found some pretty slick [`serde_scan` crate](https://docs.rs/serde_scan/0.4.0/serde_scan/):

```rust
let (a, b, ch, pass): (usize, usize, char, String) =
    serde_scan::scan!("{}-{} {}: {}" <- line).unwrap();
```
