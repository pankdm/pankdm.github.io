[This year](https://icfpcontest2021.github.io/) was about fitting the given figure into a given contour, 
inspired by famous [Japanese TV Show Brain Wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_Wall).

This is example of one the tasks:

This was my [12-th year](/icfpc.html) participating in ICFPC. Below are some of my random thoughts
and screenshots.


## Final results

We finished at 25th place:

We were at 24st place in frozen monitor with 11k more scores submitted after freezing the monitor.
This would brought us to 22nd place assuming other teams did nothing:

## Members

This year we continued to write from one location and also got a new team member, bringing the total number to 6:

- Dmitry K.
- Dmitry P.
- Mikhail K.
- Oleg G.
- Victor K.
- Vitaly A.

## Languages used
 - Javascript (UI)
 - Python (attempts at solvers)

## Solution


Our main approach was to build user interface tool to assist the human in manually solving the puzzles.
At some it became obvious that automated solvers approach is not fruitfull for us so we went all-in on this UI.
Over time it grow in functionality so much and so that we started calling it `ICFPC IDE`.

### UI

Here is overview of main funtionality:
- `Physics: on/off`
  - Enables spring forces on edges that helps the vertices to stabilize
- `Inflate`
  - Moves points out of each other. This is helpful in untangling the vertex mess
- `Hole In`
  - Applies gravity force at each of the hole vertices.
    Helps to move the points closer to hole edges.
- `Glue Points`
  - Attaches points to fixed position so that they don't move when physics is enabled
- `Snap Winners`
  - Glues points that are located in the hole vertices
- `Snap`
  - Snaps points to integer coordiantes
- `Traffic Light`
  - Shows red/green depending if solution is good for submittion
- `Save`
  - Saves the solution as checkpoint (with glued points) or for submission (clean json).


Running the UI:
```
cd ui/ && yarn install && yarn dev
```
then navigate to [http://localhost:3000]()
