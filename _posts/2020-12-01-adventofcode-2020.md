This is my notes about solving Advent of Code 2020 in Rust. 


# Day 1

- There was outage for the first 10 minutes so there were no leaderboard scores
- I solved this using 3 nested loops:

```rust
for i in 0..x.len() {
    for j in 0..i {
        for k in 0..j {
            if x[i] + x[j] + x[k] == 2020 {
                return x[i] * x[j] * x[k];
            }
        }
    }
}
```

- Afterwards learned about `combinations` function from [`itertools` crate](https://docs.rs/itertools/0.9.0/itertools/trait.Itertools.html#method.combinations):

```rust
let v = x
    .iter()
    .cloned()
    .combinations(3)
    .filter(|it| it.iter().sum::<i64>() == 2020)
    .next()
    .unwrap();
return v[0] * v[1] * v[2]
```

- Using `tuple_combinations` from the same package looks even cleaner:

```rust
let res = x
    .iter()
    .cloned()
    .tuple_combinations()
    .find_map(|(a, b, c)| {
        if a + b + c == 2020 {
            Some(a * b * c)
        } else {
            None
        }
    })
    .unwrap();
return res
```


# Day 2


- Solved in 5/9 minutes and got around 800th place overall

<img src="img/aoc-2020/day02.png" style="width: 75%;"/>


- Wasted some time figuring out how to index `String`-s in Rust. The syntax is pretty ugly:

```rust
let ch = parts[1].chars().nth(0).unwrap();
```

- Lost another minute or so with incorrect answers as missed 1-indexing of arrays
- Initially did some parsing using my `split_string` and `parse_i64` functions:

```rust
let parts = split_string(line, " ");
let nums = split_string(&parts[0], "-");
let a = parse_i64(&nums[0]);
let b = parse_i64(&nums[1]);
let ch = parts[1].chars().nth(0).unwrap();
let pass = parts[2];
```

- Afterwards found some pretty slick [`serde_scan` crate](https://docs.rs/serde_scan/0.4.0/serde_scan/):

```rust
let (a, b, ch, pass): (usize, usize, char, String) =
    serde_scan::scan!("{}-{} {}: {}" <- line).unwrap();
```


## Day 3

- Solved in `6:44/10:11` minutes and got at `#1240/#953` in global leaderboard

<img src="img/aoc-2020/day03.png" style="width: 75%;"/>

- Screwed up several times while trying to skim the statement too fast:
  - Missed that starting point is (1, 3) and not (0, 0) - this probably doesn't matter since the start is not at tree
  - Didn't realize that the map is cyclical
  - Missed that we need to multiply all numbers instead of sum
- Regarding Rust itself - I don't like the access pattern for strings, so maybe I should have a helper to quickly convert `String` to `Vec<Char>`:

```rust
pub fn to_vv_char(lines: &Vec<String>) -> Vec<Vec<char>> {
    lines.iter().map(|x| x.chars().collect()).collect()
}
```


## Day 4

- Solved in `11:19/28:05` minutes and got at `#1800/1091` in global leaderboard

<img src="img/aoc-2020/day04.png" style="width: 75%;"/>

- Didn't really like the problem since it was pretty straightforward but required a lot of careful coding
- Maybe that's an opportunity to learn how to do that more efficiently in Rust (e.g. use regexps)
- For first part missed that `cid` is optional
- Also wasted some time with incorrect parsing - didn't take into account last block
- Surprisingly second part worked out of the box the first time I finished it
- Will check if I can simplify some of the code
- Found that `Vec` has method `contains` and splitting the string is probably faster than changing it to a vector, so `ecl` check could be written as following:

```rust
fn check_ecl(s: &String) -> bool {
    let opts = split_string(&"amb blu brn gry grn hzl oth".to_string(), " ");
    opts.contains(s)
}
```

- iterators have methd `.all` that could be used for simplification:

```rust
fn is_all_digits(s: &String) -> bool {
    s.chars().all(|c| c.is_numeric())
}
```

## Day 5

- Solved in `7:07/8:54` minutes and got at `#593/379` place. The best result so far!

<img src="img/aoc-2020/day05.png" style="width: 75%;"/>


- Was pretty straightforward problem - I feel that I didn't really screwed up anywhere
- Initially I implemented the binary search as described, but later turned out you can just convert the input string to binary treating "BR" -> 1 and "FL" -> 0:

```rust
fn get_seat_id_bin(s: &String) -> i64 {
    let x: String = s
        .chars()
        .map(|c| match c {
            'B' | 'R' => '1',
            _ => '0',
        })
        .collect();
    isize::from_str_radix(&x, 2).unwrap() as i64
}
```
 - Or using `.replace` instead:

```rust
fn get_seat_id_bin(s: &String) -> i64 {
    let x = s.replace("B", "1").replace("R", "1").replace("L", "0").replace("F", "0");
    isize::from_str_radix(&x, 2).unwrap() as i64
}
```

## Day 6

- Solved in `6:31/8:59` and got at `#1911/#839`: was a little slow than people in part 1 but then got faster in part 2.

<img src="img/aoc-2020/day06.png" style="width: 75%;"/>

- The parsing was pretty similar to day 4 and I still was using awkward state based parsing which is slower to implement
- Would be interesting to switch to `.split("\n\n")` based parsing since this seems more effective
- Part 1 using this approach:

```rust
pub fn part1(data: &str) -> i64 {
    data.trim()
        .split("\n\n")
        .map(|x| x.replace("\n", ""))
        .map(|x| {
            let set: HashSet<_> = x.chars().collect();
            set.len() as i64
        })
        .sum()
}
```
- Interestingly, Rust now only has `.fold(value, func)` which accumulates results into initial value. There is [`.fold_first(func)`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html#method.fold_first) method in nightly that is more similar to traditional `reduce` (it uses the first value as initial).
- There is alo [discussion on rust-lang API for supporting multiple sets](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues/2023)
- Without that writing part 2 is a little awkward:

```rust
pub fn part2(data: &str) -> i64 {
    data.trim()
        .split("\n\n")
        .map(|x| x.split("\n"))
        .map(|lines| {
            let sets: Vec<_> = lines
                .map(|x| {
                    let set: HashSet<_> = x.chars().collect();
                    set
                })
                .collect();
            sets.iter()
                .fold(sets[0].clone(), |acc, s| {
                    acc.intersection(&s).copied().collect()
                })
                .len() as i64
        })
        .sum()
}
```

## Day 7

- Solved in `21:27/30:08` and got at `#1305/#1006`.

<img src="img/aoc-2020/day07.png" style="width: 75%;"/>

- Spent some time trying to make fancy serde_scan work, but didn't succeed and swtiched back to regular parsing/splitting
- Solved part 1 using BFS and part 2 using DFS with caching
- Learned cool API in Rust to populate `HashMap<_, Vec<_>>`. In C++ this is easy because of default ctor-s, but in Rust the convenient way to use the following:

```rust
g.entry(input_bag.clone())
    .or_insert(Vec::new())
    .push((num, output_bag.clone()));
```

- Parsing could also be re-written using `regex` crate:

```rust
let re = Regex::new("(.*) contain (.*)[.]").unwrap();
let cap = re.captures(line).unwrap();
let src = cap.get(1).unwrap().as_str();
let dsts = cap.get(2).unwrap().as_str();
```


## Day 8

- Solved in `10:40/16:47` and got at `#2519/#1144`.

<img src="img/aoc-2020/day08.png" style="width: 75%;"/>


- Pretty slow overall as I spent debugging a few bugs in code:
   - Missed `ip` increment on regular instructions
   - Overflow of jump backwards instruction
- Learned that using pattern matching can make the program nicer:

```rust
fn run_prog(prog: &Vec<Op>) -> (bool, i64) {
    let mut acc = 0;
    let mut ip = 0;
    let mut visited = HashMap::new();
    loop {
        if ip as usize >= prog.len() {
            return (true, acc);
        }
        let key = ip;
        if visited.contains_key(&key) {
            return (false, acc);
        }
        visited.insert(key, true);
        let p = &prog[ip as usize];
        match p.name.as_str() {
            "acc" => {
                acc += p.value;
                ip += 1;
            }
            "jmp" => {
                ip = (ip + p.value).max(0);
            }
            _ => {
                ip += 1;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Day 9

```
      -------Part 1--------   -------Part 2--------
Day       Time  Rank  Score       Time  Rank  Score
  9   00:07:27  1224      0   00:13:01   887      0
```

- Pretty easy day again. Mostly fighting my own typos / mistakes.
- Learned a few cool things though.
- Rust has convenient lambdas defined inline that could capture values from outside:

```rust
let is_valid = |x, start, end| {
    for i in start..end {
        for j in start..i {
            if v[i] + v[j] == x {
                return true;
            }
        }
    }
    return false;
};
```

  - Rust ranges work on vectors:

```rust
let s: i64 = v[i..=j].iter().sum();
let min = v[i..=j].iter().min().unwrap();
let max = v[i..=j].iter().max().unwrap();
```


## Day 10

```
      -------Part 1--------   -------Part 2--------
Day       Time  Rank  Score       Time  Rank  Score
 10   00:06:01   559      0   00:14:10   358      0
```

 - Did pretty good - was pretty straightforward dynamic programming and worked almost from the first run
