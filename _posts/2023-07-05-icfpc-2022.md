title:  "ICFPC 2022: Robovinci"
---

This year task was about drawing art paintings using commands for a special robot.

## Final results

We finished at 18th place!

## Overall impression

This was a great contest! Very intuitive problem, interactive leaderboard to compete and flawless infrastructure on organizer's side.

## Members

Same as last year, we had the following members:

- Dmitry K.
- Dmitry P.
- Mikhail K.
- Oleg G.
- Victor K.
- Vitaly A.

## Languages used

- Python (solver)
- Java (solution optimizer)
- Javascript (UI)

## Solution

We found that you can draw pretty detailed pictures if you start from one of the opposite corners and gradually go backwards. We had a python-based solver doing that. This was a baseline for our solution.

Additionally we have an optimizer written in Java (miner) that would take existing solution and start refining that by moving each step for a few pixels. This produced another good source of score improvements.

Finally we had a UI where you can visualize each solution step-by-step and look for insights.

## Misc Stuff

Organizers were extremely kind to keep only the best scores in submissions:

For `Problem 1` chess, we manually fine-tuned the sequence of cuts and swaps:

<table>
<tr>
    <td>
    <img src="img/icfpc-2022/chess-part-1.gif" style="width: 100%;"/>
    </td>
    <td>
    <img src="img/icfpc-2022/chess-part-2.gif" style="width: 100%;"/>
    </td>
</tr>
</table>

Solution for `Problem 3` where we almost manually produced the result through the UI, getting very close to optimal scores.

After implementing DSL in python, the solution looked like this:

```python
    b = Block("0", begin = (0, 0), end = (400, 400))
    [_, b1] = b.line_y(400 - (sum(rows_lengths) + extra_row), prog)
    [b2, _] = b1.line_x(sum(left_sides) + sum(right_sides) + extra_side, prog)
    [b3, main_block] = b2.line_y(b2.begin[1] + extra_row, prog)
    [bottom_line, _] = b3.line_x(sum(left_sides) + sum(right_sides), prog)

    split_by_lines(main_block, bottom_line)
```
